    "### RoboBuoy TODO's\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long Range LORA Implementation & Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loss of BLE connection causes ESP to crash why ?\n",
    "- improve code terminology\n",
    "  - course : The direction in which a vessel is being steered, usually given in degrees.\n",
    "  - heading : The direction in which the nose of a vessel is pointing (which is not necessarily the same as the direction in which the vessel is actually moving).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Terminology Improvemnts\n",
    "  - use Heading instead of course\n",
    "  - use Bearing instead of dedired course\n",
    "  - use Thrust instead of surge\n",
    "- Create Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready for test\n",
    "- &#9744; A way to fuse the gps cource, even when the robot is very slow, or not really moving\n",
    "- &#9744; State based Magnetomerter Calibration Sequence\n",

    "#### Intialize Zoom\n",
    "- Zoom to the Planet\n",
    "- Zoom to the Extent of the motor boat when geolocation is found\n",
    "- Zoom to the Extent of the Robots as they become availble\n",
    "- if a course is defined, zoom to the extent of the course\n",
    "- if a course feature is selected (double click) zoom to the extent of the selected feature\n",
    "- if a cource feature is already in the zoom focus, a double click will return to the previos zoom state\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Boundary\n",
    "- Create a Cource with translate, rotate and scale aroung an anchor point\n",
    "- The Scale should maintain the rectangle shape\n",
    "- The Aspect ratio of the course can change\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Select a Race Pattern\n",
    "- Select a race pattern of bouys\n",
    "- A race pattern can include bouys, startlines and gates\n",
    "- The bouys, and gates are translatebale within the course boundary\n",
    "- Startlines ang Gates are bound by a line\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Position the Bouys\n",
    "- The user can create a track of waypoints for the robotos to follow onto the cource area\n",
    "- The track path is demarcated from a home point to a stagin point\n",
    "- If the user selects the staging point robots will proceed along the waypoints to the staging point\n",
    "- If the user selects the home point the robots will process along the waypoints to the home point\n",
    "- if a Course Boundary and Race Pattern is present, the user can press \"GO\" where the buoys will take-up theri positions.\n",
